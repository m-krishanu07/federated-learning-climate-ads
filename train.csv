Last Friday, Energy Transfer representatives toured the construction site of Aston Twp. Fire Dept.'s new state-of-the-art facility, and presented a $44,014.80 grant for new equipment.

“Between rising operations costs and having to cancel our primary fundraisers this year due to the pandemic, our fire department is essentially ‘breaking even,’” said Aston Township Fire Chief Mike Evans. “This grant from Energy Transfer, along with grants from Aston Township and the state of Pennsylvania, came at the perfect time and will allow us to better serve our community as we work to build a new, state-of-the-art facility.”
